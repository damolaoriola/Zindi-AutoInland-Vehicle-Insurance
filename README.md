# Zindi-AutoInland-Vehicle-Insurance Challenge:
## My 14th place solution for the Zindi-Autoinland challenge. 

AutoInland (an Insurance company in west Africa with a focus on Auto Insurance) required a predictive model that determines if a customer will submit a vehicle insurance claim in the next three months given information about the customer in the database. This solution will help streamline financial planning at AutoInland and allow them to better serve their customers by understanding which customers are likely to submit a claim  needs to make every point of contact count; one of the most valuable of these is filing and settlement of claims.

My approach involved exploratory data analysis to understand the factors driving autoinsurance claims afterwards modelling using an ensemble of two LightGBM dart mode models.
